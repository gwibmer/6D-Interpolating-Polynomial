# 6D-Interpolating-Polynomial

I implemented a six-dimensional Interpolating Polynomial to control the movement of a UR5 robot from a start position to a goal position. The algorithm calculated a smooth and precise trajectory for the robot to follow, using interpolating polynomials to ensure accurate and efficient motion. The implementation involved integrating advanced mathematical concepts and robotics principles to create a solution that can be applied in various industrial and research settings. This project allowed me to demonstrate my skills in mathematical modeling, algorithm design, and robotic programming. 12/06/2022
